## Building for Android

To build for Android:

1. Prepare your environment for Android builds:
   ```bash
   # Install buildozer
   pip install buildozer
   
   # On Ubuntu/Debian, install required packages
   sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip build-essential git python3 python3-dev \
       libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev \
       libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev zlib1g-dev
